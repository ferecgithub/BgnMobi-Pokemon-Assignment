# BgnMobi-Pokemon-Assignment
A technical challenge that requires using the modern Android development tools

### Used Technologies and Libraries
* Clean Architecture & MVVM
* Kotlin
* Jetpack Components ( Navigation, Paging3, Lifecycle, ViewModel )
* Retrofit, OkHttp
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Coil
* Dagger Hilt
* Firebase services (Crashlytics & Cloud Messaging)

### The Requirements Checklist
1) Project running properly between Android 5.0 (API 21) and Android 12.0 (API 31)    **ðŸ—¸**
2) Error handling and displaying a proper message when internet connection is slow or not available   **ðŸ—¸**
3) Adding localization for both Turkish and English languages   **ðŸ—¸**
4) Adhering to SOLID principles   **ðŸ—¸**
5) Publishing the project on a public repository (GitHub, Bitbucket etc.)   **ðŸ—¸**
6) Java or Kotlin can be used as programming language. Using Kotlin is a plus.    **ðŸ—¸**
7) Navigation component / navigation graph should be used for screen transitions.    **ðŸ—¸**
8) MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) structure should be used.    **ðŸ—¸**
9) Dependency injection (dagger-hilt) should be used.    **ðŸ—¸**
10) View binding should be used.   **ðŸ—¸**
11) Use and integration of Firebase libraries is required (crashlytics, push notification).    **ðŸ—¸**
12) Where necessary (if the application language is Kotlin), it is a plus to use Coroutines.    **ðŸ—¸**
13) Writing a unit test will be considered a big plus. **ðŸ—¸**
14) App modularization would be considered a big plus. (The package structure is prepared having modularization in mind. I didn't modularize to finish the assignment ASAP.)
